Chrome extension that doesn't allow to open new tabs in a unique way.

Whenever you try to open a new tab it opens a youtube video that is disappointed in you for getting distracted.
We are just overriding chrome url that is all, there are 10 video links which are randomly opened evrey time you click on new tab.

Improvements:
The extension is always on, need to a toggle kind of feature to switch it on and off whenever you want to.
Need to add more and/or better video links.
Also need to add one nice icon for the extension.
